## Tasks and planning:

### We are single-core: multi-tasking is evil

Multi-tasking was and probably still is a buzzword met pretty often in job requirements, perceived as an asset of a
personality. I do not know why. While there are sometimes situations that demand from us to juggle multiple tasks, we
are single-core by nature. Context switches are inefficient even for machines, and we shall avoid them at all cost. If
you have to do multiple things at once, just write them done and do one by one. Eventually, you will perform much better
than trying to "multi-task".

### Do the most important thing as a first thing in the morning

Doing the most important thing right away in the morning will not only ensure that important things are done, but will
give you a great feeling of accomplishment for the rest of the day.

### Follow your body

Try to understand your body and how you feel across the day and week. Understand at what hours and days you are full of
energy and do not waste them as they give you the maximum potential for a creative and effective work. Conversely, there
are hours/days better suited to a more relaxed work. It is better to allocate some easier tasks or non-engaging meetings
in that time. For example, if you feel empowered in the morning and relaxed in the afternoon, do the hard-work early and
set up meetings after the lunch, if possible. In the opposite situation, discuss the action-plan in the morning and get
your hands dirty later on. The most important is to find your rhythm and follow it.

### Have a master/perhaps list of tasks

Whatever you have to do, at work or in your personal life, put this into a general TODO list (called also a "master"
or "perhaps" list) immediately. You can forget them after they get into the list - you are not going to miss them after
all. Review the list regularly (daily or weekly) and put things to do into your calendar. The beauty of this approach is
that it does not only free your mind, but you can be sure that you will never forget to do what has to be done.
Additionally, some tasks tend to get solved by themselves after some time.

### Do short tasks right away

If the task requires no more than few (2-3 mins), do it right away as putting it into a list will take a significant
amount of time for the task completion. Unless you have a plenty of such tasks that will jeopardize getting more
important things done.

### Learn how to procrastinate

Procrastination is not necessarily evil, if used wisely. There are some tasks that it is better to do later than
earlier. When there is a chance that you will get more information about the task that will improve the overall result
or there is a chance that a thing will resolve by itself, just put it into a todo list or in a calendar in a remote
period.

### Batch similar tasks together

Another good solution for context-switches. Batching similar tasks will allow you to remain in the flow and do things
quicker and with more pleasure.

### Put a limit for a task

Make an agreement with yourself to dedicate only some realistic but still a tight timeline for a particular task. This
will make you focus on what is the most important and prevent trying to make it "perfect".

### Learn to say "no"

To be performant, we have to say "no" sometimes. It is always good to explain why we cannot handle yet one more "small"
task and provide the alternative solution (like redirecting to people who can also help). Saying "no" is not always easy
but probably this is one of the most important thing to master. With a proper approach, we can do it tactfully and still
protect our time.

### Do less - apply Pareto law

Review your tasks or assignments periodically and understand what activities give you the most value. Usually, 20% of
them are responsible for 80% of outcomes. If something does not contribute heavily to the output, stop doing it without
any hesitation.

### Use sharing capabilities of tools
Tools and sharing capabilities used at work are also great in a family life. Share a calendar, important notes or tasks 
with your spouse. Google Calendar works great for planning visits and events, Keep or Evernote to share notes and Trello
can help in different areas, even like a shopping list. Your imagination is the only limit.


## Focus and flow:

### Take brakes often
Brakes are as important as doing the productive work. Take them often to reset your eyes, muscles and mind and just relax.
A walk outside a building, quick ping-pong session or just a tea in the kitchen - something that drags you out from the screen.
They help to maintain the focus and boost productivity. Have you noticed that great ideas often come in the break time?

### Pomodoro for the rescue
Using the Pomodoro technique is not only helpful to maintain the focus. It also ensures that you take brakes regularly which
is as important. Additionally, with Pomodoro it is much easier to understand how long we really can work focused and helps
to schedule the work. A bitter truth is we usually work with attentively only few hours per day and this can be improved
with this technique. In my personal opinion, the Pomodoro is especially useful in tight projects/schedules to keep the pace
while protecting ourselves from the burnout. It requires a bit of discipline to start using, though.

### Declutter your desktop to declutter your mind
The less you have at your desktop, the better. Same applies to organizing files and information at your machine. It is much
easier to work in an organized environment without any unnecessary distractors. Once again - "less is more".

### Schedule a time to... do nothing and stop thinking

Focus and flow:

- reading emails twice per day if possible
- master the keyboard and shortcuts
- batching replies on the communicator: some issues are resolved before you reply
- disabling all the notifications
- relaxing music - not in the language you understand
- reliable tools, software

Notes:

- one tool for notes at work/personal life
- a good search is a must
- spend some time to clear notes
- put whatever is interesting. Keep / Pocket, OneNote

Meetings:

- agendas, do not attend meetings if not really needed
- focus on meetings, multitasking is bad
- leave a buffer between meetings
- determine your results before the meeting

Automation:

- bash scripts for the rescue, automating
- templates of messages
- transferrable configuration
- know your IDE
- automatic backups etc.
- organize your email by automatic rules
- creating documentation - automatic replies to questions

Other:

- learn to say "no" - provide the alternative solution
- have a kindle with you (two books are good)
- do less: "less is more"
- be imperfect, make it better over time
- learn something different, experiment
- turn things into habits
- learn to do nothing
- experiment with tools, routes etc.
- ask questions instead of searching own solution for a longer time
- audiobooks, 1.5x time or faster
- sleeping and power naps
