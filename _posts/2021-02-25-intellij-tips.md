IntelliJ IDEA is almost like a good game - easy to learn, difficult to master. It takes time to learn all the goodies it provides and just because JetBrains provide
new fantastic features regularly, it gets even more time to catch up. There are so many posts describing its great features and this is going to be another one.
Still, maybe you will find something new here that you did not know? Even if I am going to write only about my favourites, it looks like it is a material for an entire post series.
